Bitelist App 
=============

      brew install postgresql

To Dos:
--------

1. Allow users to follow each other
2. Allow users to upload their favorite places to eat using the Yelp API (as autocomplete?) - max 15 per region/city
3. Allow users to sync with selected people they follow
4. Add facebook connect that suggests friends already in their fb network to follow
5. Create JSON API so we can start the native iOS app
5. Add SSL/https to signon
